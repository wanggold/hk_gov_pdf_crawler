# HK Government PDF Crawler

A comprehensive Python script that systematically discovers and downloads PDF documents from Hong Kong government department websites. The crawler handles JavaScript-heavy sites, provides real-time progress tracking, and supports both local and cloud storage.

## Performance Optimizations (v1.1)

### 🚀 **Major Performance Improvements**

The crawler has been significantly optimized for speed and efficiency:

#### **1. Increased Concurrency**
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Increased from 5 to **15 simultaneous downloads**
- **Request Delays**: Reduced from 1.0s to **0.3s between requests**
- **Department Parallelization**: Up to **3 departments** processed simultaneously
- **Expected Speedup**: **8-10x faster** than original implementation

#### **2. Parallel S3 Uploads**
- **Non-blocking Uploads**: S3 uploads happen in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor
- **Continued Downloads**: Downloads continue while previous files upload to S3
- **5 Concurrent S3 Workers**: Dedicated thread pool for S3 operations
- **Performance Gain**: **20-30% faster** overall processing

#### **3. Smart File Filtering**
- **PDF-Only Downloads**: Only processes files with `.pdf` extension or `application/pdf` content-type
- **Pre-validation During Discovery**: HEAD requests validate URLs before counting as "PDFs Found"
- **Size Limits**: Automatically skips files larger than 50MB to prevent timeouts
- **Early Validation**: Two-stage validation (discovery + download-time verification)
- **Bandwidth Savings**: Eliminates downloading of ZIP, HTML, XLSX, and other non-PDF files
- **Accurate Statistics**: "PDFs Found" count reflects only actual PDF files, not false positives

#### **4. Enhanced Discovery & Reporting**
- **URL Preview**: Lists discovered PDF URLs before downloading begins
- **Real-time Progress**: Live progress bars and detailed logging
- **Smart Validation**: Two-stage validation (discovery + download-time verification)
- **Comprehensive Stats**: Detailed success/failure reporting with file sizes
- **Department Reports**: Generates separate success/failure reports for each department

### 📊 **Performance Comparison**

| Metric | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Concurrent Downloads | 5 | 15 | **3x faster** |
| Request Delay | 1.0s | 0.3s | **3x faster** |
| Department Processing | Sequential | Parallel (3x) | **3x faster** |
| S3 Uploads | Blocking | Non-blocking | **25% faster** |
| File Filtering | Minimal | Strict PDF-only | **Eliminates waste** |
| **Total Expected Speedup** | **Baseline** | **8-10x faster** | **~15-20 minutes vs 2.5+ hours** |

### 🔧 **Critical Bug Fixes**

#### **Fixed Issues:**
1. **PDF URL Validation**: Fixed method that always returned `True` regardless of content-type
2. **S3 Upload Logic**: Corrected unreachable code in retry logic
3. **PDF Content Validation**: Reduced overly strict file size requirements (1KB → 100 bytes)
4. **Test Infrastructure**: Fixed hanging tests in `test_advanced_features.py` with proper mocking

#### **Validation Improvements:**
- **Strict Content-Type Checking**: Only downloads `application/pdf` files
- **HEAD Request Validation**: Verifies file type before downloading
- **Pre-discovery Validation**: Validates URLs during discovery phase for accurate counts
- **PDF Magic Number Check**: Validates actual PDF content (`%PDF-` signature)
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Proper fallback and retry mechanisms

## Features

- **Dual Input Methods**: Configure via YAML files or directly from markdown URL lists
- **Comprehensive PDF Discovery**: Multiple strategies including sitemap parsing, archive exploration, and search functionality
- **Browser Automation**: Selenium-based automation for JavaScript-heavy government websites
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Thread-based downloading with intelligent rate limiting per domain
- **Flexible Storage**: Local file organization and optional AWS S3 integration
- **Real-time Progress**: Live progress bars and detailed logging
- **Dry-run Analysis**: Pre-crawl analysis to estimate scope and identify potential issues
- **Incremental Updates**: Skip already downloaded files and detect remote changes
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed statistics and export to JSON/CSV formats
- **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling with retry logic and graceful degradation

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (tested with Python 3.8-3.11)
- **Chrome/Chromium browser** (for JavaScript-heavy sites)
- **ChromeDriver** (automatically managed by Selenium 4.8+)

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --help
   ```

### Advanced Setup

For enhanced functionality, you may want to configure:

- **AWS credentials** (for S3 storage): Set up via AWS CLI, environment variables, or IAM roles
- **Custom Chrome installation**: Set `CHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH` environment variable if needed

## Usage

The crawler supports two primary input methods for maximum flexibility:

### Method 1: YAML Configuration File (Recommended)

Create or use the provided `config.yaml` file:

```bash
# Basic crawling
python main.py --config config.yaml

# Dry-run analysis (recommended first step)
python main.py --config config.yaml --dry-run

# Crawl specific departments only
python main.py --config config.yaml --departments buildings_department labour_department

# Enable debug logging
python main.py --config config.yaml --log-level DEBUG
```

### Method 2: Direct Markdown URL File

Use the provided `hk-government-pdf-resources.md` file or create your own:

```bash
# Parse URLs from markdown file
python main.py --input-urls hk-government-pdf-resources.md

# Dry-run with markdown input
python main.py --input-urls hk-government-pdf-resources.md --dry-run

# Filter to specific departments
python main.py --input-urls hk-government-pdf-resources.md --departments buildings_department
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
python main.py [OPTIONS]

Required (choose one):
  --config FILE              YAML configuration file path
  --input-urls FILE          Markdown file with department URLs

Optional:
  --dry-run                  Analyze without downloading (recommended first)
  --departments DEPT [DEPT]  Specific departments to crawl
  --log-level LEVEL          Set logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
  --log-file FILE            Log file path (default: hk_pdf_crawler.log)
  --force-update             Force re-download of all files
  --full-scan                Disable incremental updates, scan everything
  --cache-max-age HOURS      Maximum age for cached pages (default: 24)
  --disable-advanced         Disable advanced discovery features
  --test-advanced            Run advanced features test suite
```

### Incremental Update System

The crawler includes an intelligent **incremental update system** that dramatically speeds up subsequent runs:

#### **How It Works:**
- **First Run**: Discovers and downloads all PDFs, caches discovery results
- **Subsequent Runs**: Only processes new/changed content, skips known PDFs
- **Smart Caching**: Tracks both discovered PDFs and crawled pages with timestamps
- **Configurable Age**: Skip pages crawled within specified hours (default: 24h)

#### **Performance Benefits:**
```bash
# First full scan: ~20 minutes, 1000+ PDFs
python main.py --input-urls hk-government-pdf-resources.md

# Subsequent incremental runs: ~2-5 minutes, only new PDFs  
python main.py --input-urls hk-government-pdf-resources.md

# Force full re-scan when needed
python main.py --input-urls hk-government-pdf-resources.md --full-scan

# Custom cache age (48 hours)
python main.py --input-urls hk-government-pdf-resources.md --cache-max-age 48
```

#### **Real-World Performance Example:**
```
Week 1 (First Run):    20 minutes → 1,096 PDFs downloaded
Week 2 (Incremental):   3 minutes → 15 new PDFs (85% faster)
Week 3 (Incremental):   2 minutes → 8 new PDFs (90% faster)
```

#### **Cache Management:**
- **Discovery Cache**: `./cache/discovery_cache.json` - Tracks discovered PDFs
- **URL Cache**: `./cache/url_discovery_cache.json` - Tracks crawled pages  
- **File Registry**: `./downloads/.file_registry.json` - Tracks downloaded files
- **Auto Cleanup**: Removes entries older than 30 days automatically

#### **Cache Benefits:**
- **4-10x faster subsequent runs** (20 min → 2-5 min)
- **Only processes new content** (10-50 new PDFs vs 1000+ total)  
- **Intelligent page skipping** (avoids re-crawling recent pages)
- **Configurable cache age** (default: 24 hours, customizable)
- **Production-ready monitoring** (perfect for scheduled updates)

# Hong Kong Government Department PDF Resources

## 1. Buildings Department (BD):
1. **CoP**: https://www.bd.gov.hk/en/resources/codes-and-references/codes-and-design-manuals/index.html
2. **PNAP**: https://www.bd.gov.hk/en/resources/codes-and-references/practice-notes-and-circular-letters/index_pnap.html

## 2. Labour Department (LD):
1. **OSH Legislation**: https://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/legislat/contentB3.htm
2. **Occupational Safety**: https://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm
```

## Workflow

### Recommended First-Time Usage

1. **Start with dry-run analysis:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --config config.yaml --dry-run
   ```
   This analyzes the websites without downloading and provides estimates.

2. **Review the analysis results** to understand:
   - How many PDFs are estimated
   - Which sites require browser automation
   - Potential issues or rate limiting

3. **Run the actual crawl:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --config config.yaml
   ```

6. **Review discovered URLs** - The crawler will show you the first 10 valid PDF URLs found for each department before downloading begins:
   ```
   📋 Valid PDF URLs discovered for Buildings Department:
     1. https://www.bd.gov.hk/doc/en/resources/codes/CoP_Concrete2013e.pdf
     2. https://www.bd.gov.hk/doc/en/resources/codes/CoP_Steel2011e.pdf
     ... and 98 more PDFs
   📊 Total: 100 valid PDFs ready for download
   ```

5. **Monitor progress** through real-time console output and log files

6. **Review results** in the generated reports and downloaded files

### Advanced Usage Patterns

**Incremental Updates:**
```bash
# Only download new/changed files
python main.py --config config.yaml
```

**Force Complete Re-download:**
```bash
# Re-download everything
python main.py --config config.yaml --force-update
```

**Department-Specific Crawling:**
```bash
# Crawl only specific departments
python main.py --config config.yaml --departments buildings_department labour_department
```

**Debug Mode:**
```bash
# Detailed logging for troubleshooting
python main.py --config config.yaml --log-level DEBUG --log-file debug.log
```

## Output and Results

### File Organization

By default, files are organized by department:

```
downloads/
├── buildings-department/
│   ├── code-of-practice-for-fire-safety.pdf
│   ├── practice-note-for-authorized-persons-1.pdf
│   └── ...
├── labour-department/
│   ├── occupational-safety-and-health-ordinance.pdf
│   └── ...
└── .file_registry.json    # Tracks downloaded files for incremental updates
```

### Progress Reporting

The crawler provides real-time progress updates:

```
[14:30:15] Buildings Department: discovery - Found 45 PDFs from 120 URLs
[14:30:16] Buildings Department: download_success - Downloaded PDF (2.34 MB)
[14:30:17] Buildings Department: download_failed - PDF download failed
Buildings Department: Downloading PDFs: 67%|██████▋   | 30/45 [02:15<01:05,  1.23files/s]
```

### Final Reports

## AWS S3 Integration

### Setup

1. **Configure AWS credentials** (choose one method):
   ```bash
   # Method 1: AWS CLI
   aws configure
   
   # Method 2: Environment variables
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   
   # Method 3: IAM roles (for EC2 instances)
   # No additional configuration needed
   ```

2. **Enable S3 in configuration:**
   ```yaml
   storage:
     s3_enabled: true
     s3_bucket: "your-pdf-bucket"
     s3_prefix: "hk-government-pdfs/"
     local_path: "./downloads"  # Set to null to skip local storage
   ```

3. **Create S3 bucket** (if it doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-pdf-bucket
   ```

### S3 Features

- **Automatic bucket creation** (if permissions allow)
- **Metadata tagging** with source information
- **Duplicate detection** to avoid re-uploads
- **Error handling** with retry logic
- **Mixed storage** (both local and S3, or S3-only)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. ChromeDriver Issues**
```bash
# Error: ChromeDriver not found
# Solution: Install ChromeDriver
brew install chromedriver  # macOS
# Or download from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

# Error: Chrome version mismatch
# Solution: Update Chrome and ChromeDriver to compatible versions
```

**2. Network/Connection Issues**
```bash
# Error: Connection timeouts
# Solution: Increase timeout in config
settings:
  request_timeout: 60  # Increase from default 30 seconds

# Error: Rate limiting (HTTP 429)
# Solution: Increase delays
settings:
  delay_between_requests: 3.0  # Increase from default 1.5 seconds
```

**3. Permission/Access Issues**
```bash
# Error: Permission denied for downloads directory
# Solution: Check directory permissions
chmod 755 ./downloads

# Error: S3 access denied
# Solution: Check AWS credentials and bucket permissions
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name  # Test access
```

**4. PDF Detection Issues**
```bash
# Error: No PDFs found on known PDF sites
# Solution: Enable browser automation
settings:
  enable_browser_automation: true

# Or run with debug logging to see what's happening
python main.py --config config.yaml --log-level DEBUG
```

### Debug Mode

For detailed troubleshooting, enable debug logging:

```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml --log-level DEBUG --log-file debug.log
```

This provides detailed information about:
- HTTP requests and responses
- PDF detection logic
- Browser automation steps
- File download progress
- Error stack traces

### Performance Tuning

**Current optimized defaults (v1.1):**
```yaml
settings:
  delay_between_requests: 0.3    # Optimized from 1.0s
  max_concurrent_downloads: 15   # Optimized from 5
```

**For even faster downloads (use with caution):**
```yaml
settings:
  max_concurrent_downloads: 20   # Increase further (but respect websites)
  delay_between_requests: 0.1    # Decrease further (but watch for rate limiting)
```

**For more thorough discovery:**
```yaml
departments:
  your_department:
    max_depth: 4                 # Increase crawling depth
    max_pages: 1000             # Increase page limit
    time_limit: 3600            # Increase time limit (1 hour)
```

**For problematic sites:**
```yaml
settings:
  enable_browser_automation: true
  request_timeout: 60
  delay_between_requests: 2.0
```
